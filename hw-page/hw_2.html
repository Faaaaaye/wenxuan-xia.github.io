	<h5><strong>Total Evaluation Standard:</strong></h5>
	<p>I use total = GPA/4 + (GRE_V-130)/40 + (GRE_Q-130)/40 + Essay/6 + Recom/10 to determine total score. All parts are regarded to have same importance. So I simply calculate <strong>every percentile</strong> of total score, and adds them up.</p>
	<p>What's more, I assume the upbound of Recom is 10.</p>
	<p><strong>The ranking algorithm:</strong> Using bubble-sort to find the ranking according to total score. And then, sort them back according to my seq-mark.</p>
	<br/>
	<h5><strong>Addtional Statement</strong></h5>
	<p>I tried to load the json file from <a href="http://yijisoo.github.io/ie59000/2015spring/hw2/students.json">http://yijisoo.github.io/ie59000/2015spring/hw2/students.json</a>, but <strong>failed</strong>.</p>
	<p>The reason is that getJSON denies links from outside of domain URL. I also tried jsonp, but the data is not in jsonp style.</p>
	<p>Finally, I <strong>copy the file and store</strong> it in ./data folder, to make it accessible.</p>
